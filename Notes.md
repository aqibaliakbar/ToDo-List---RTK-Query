` We have all the todos in data folder file db.json as we are going to use json server

` We will install json server by typing 'npm i json-server -g'

` In order to start a server we type 'json-server --watch data/db.json --port 3500' here we have given the location of data --watch data/db.json and specify the port --port 3500. It will identify our todos and start watching them so now it will support create read update and delete functions.

` for integrating with RTK query we start by creating api folder in features directory. api is default if we name it something else we have to specify that for RTK query. It represents the api in our code.


======================================================================================================================

RTK (Redux Toolkit) is a popular library that provides a set of utilities and abstractions to simplify the management of state and data flow in Redux-based applications. RTK includes a standardized way of structuring Redux code, as well as a collection of helper functions for performing common tasks, such as making API requests.

When it comes to querying data with RTK, the library provides an additional package called `@reduxjs/toolkit/query` that extends RTK's capabilities to handle data fetching and caching. The `@reduxjs/toolkit/query` package introduces a set of hooks and utilities that make it easy to manage data fetching and state updates in a Redux store.

Let's dive into the different parts of an RTK query and explore some examples:

1. **Query Slice:** A query slice is a specific part of the Redux store that is responsible for managing a particular query. It contains the configuration and state related to that query. You can define a query slice using the `createSlice` function from RTK.

Example:
```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState: { data: [], loading: false, error: null },
  reducers: {
    // ...reducer functions go here...
  },
});
```

In this example, we define a query slice named `posts`. It has an initial state with an empty array for `data`, `loading` set to `false`, and `error` set to `null`.

2. **Reducer Functions:** Reducer functions define how the state of a query slice should be updated based on different actions. RTK provides several built-in reducer functions that handle common cases, such as fetching data, updating cache, and handling errors.

Example:
```javascript
import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query';

const fetchPosts = createAsyncThunk('posts/fetchPosts', async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/posts');
  return response.json();
});

const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState: { data: [], loading: false, error: null },
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder.addCase(fetchPosts.pending, (state) => {
      state.loading = true;
    });
    builder.addCase(fetchPosts.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
      state.data = action.payload;
      state.loading = false;
    });
    builder.addCase(fetchPosts.rejected, (state, action) => {
      state.error = action.error.message;
      state.loading = false;
    });
  },
});
```

In this example, we define an asynchronous thunk called `fetchPosts` using `createAsyncThunk`. It handles the data fetching logic by making a request to the `/api/posts` endpoint and returning the JSON response.

We then use the `extraReducers` field in the `createSlice` call to define how the state should be updated based on different action types (`fetchPosts.pending`, `fetchPosts.fulfilled`, and `fetchPosts.rejected`). When `fetchPosts.pending` is dispatched, the `loading` state is set to `true`. On successful completion (`fetchPosts.fulfilled`), the `data` state is updated with the fetched posts, and `loading` is set to `false`. If an error occurs (`fetchPosts.rejected`), the `error` state is updated with the error message, and `loading` is set to `false`.

3. **Query Hooks:** RTK provides a set of hooks that simplify data fetching and subscription to query slices. These hooks handle the underlying logic of triggering the appropriate actions and managing the state for you.

Example:
```javascript
import { useQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query';

function PostsList() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery('posts/fetchPosts');

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In this example, we use the `useQuery` hook to fetch and subscribe to the query slice named `'posts/fetchPosts'`. The hook returns an object with `data`, `isLoading`, and `error` properties. We can conditionally render different UI components based on the loading state and error.

4. **CRUD Methods:** RTK query also provides built-in methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on server data. These methods simplify the process of making API requests and updating the local cache.

Example:
```javascript
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react';

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/api' }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getPosts: builder.query({
      query: () => 'posts',
    }),
    createPost: builder.mutation({
      query: (newPost) => ({
        url: 'posts',
        method: 'POST',
        body: newPost,
      }),
    }),
    updatePost: builder.mutation({
      query: ({ id, ...updates }) => ({
        url: `posts/${id}`,
        method: 'PUT',
        body: updates,
      }),
    }),
    deletePost: builder.mutation({
      query: (id) => ({
        url: `posts/${id}`,
        method: 'DELETE',
      }),
    }),
  }),
});

// Usage examples:
api.endpoints.getPosts.useQuery();
api.endpoints.createPost.useMutation({ title: 'New Post', body: 'Lorem ipsum' });
api.endpoints.updatePost.useMutation({ id: 1, title: 'Updated Title' });
api.endpoints.deletePost.useMutation(1);
```

In this example, we use the `createApi` function to create an API client. We define different endpoints (`getPosts`, `createPost`, `updatePost`, and `deletePost`) using the `query` and `mutation` methods provided by the `builder`.

Each endpoint has a `query` or `mutation` function that describes the request configuration. For example, the `getPosts` endpoint uses a simple `query` function to fetch posts from the `'posts'` URL. The `createPost` endpoint uses a `mutation` function to perform a `POST` request with a new post object as the body.

We can then use the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks provided by the endpoint objects to trigger the corresponding API requests. In the usage examples, we call these hooks to fetch posts, create a new post, update an existing post, and delete a post.

These are some of the key concepts and methods involved in performing queries with RTK. The library provides much more functionality and customization options for handling complex data fetching scenarios in Redux-based applications.

In RTK query, tags are a powerful feature that allows you to group and control the caching behavior of your API requests. They provide fine-grained control over how the cache is updated and invalidated based on specific criteria. Tags help you manage cache dependencies, selectively update or invalidate cache entries, and prevent unnecessary refetching of data.

Let's explore how tags work and their relationship with caching in RTK query:

1. **Tags in Queries and Mutations:**
   - When you define a query or mutation endpoint in RTK query, you can specify one or more tags associated with it. Tags can be any string value that helps identify and categorize the request.
   - Tags are defined using the `tags` property within the `query` or `mutation` function when configuring an endpoint.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const api = createApi({
       baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/api' }),
       endpoints: (builder) => ({
         getPosts: builder.query({
           query: () => 'posts',
           // Assigning a single tag
           tags: ['Posts'],
         }),
         createPost: builder.mutation({
           query: (newPost) => ({
             url: 'posts',
             method: 'POST',
             body: newPost,
           }),
           // Assigning multiple tags
           tags: ['Posts', 'Create'],
         }),
       }),
     });
     ```

2. **Caching with Tags:**
   - RTK query uses a built-in cache system to store and retrieve API responses. Each response is cached based on its unique cache key, which is determined by the endpoint's `query` or `mutation` function.
   - By default, each endpoint's cache entry is associated with the tags assigned to it.
   - When you make a request with a tagged endpoint, the response is cached with the assigned tags as metadata.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     api.endpoints.getPosts.useQuery();
     ```

3. **Cache Invalidation and Updating:**
   - Tags enable fine-grained control over cache invalidation and updating.
   - You can use the `invalidateTags` and `refetch` methods provided by RTK query to selectively invalidate and update cache entries associated with specific tags.
   - `invalidateTags(tags: string | string[]): void` allows you to invalidate cache entries associated with the specified tag(s).
   - `refetch(queryTags: string | string[], callback?: (endpointName: string) => void): void` triggers a refetch for all query endpoints associated with the specified tag(s).
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     // Invalidate cache entries with 'Posts' tag
     api.invalidateTags('Posts');

     // Refetch all query endpoints with 'Posts' tag
     api.refetch('Posts');
     ```

4. **Tag-Based Automatic Cache Updates:**
   - RTK query provides automatic cache updates based on tag dependencies.
   - When you perform a mutation that has one or more tags assigned, the cache entries associated with those tags are automatically updated or invalidated.
   - For example, if you create a new post using the `createPost` mutation that has the 'Posts' tag assigned, the cache entries for the 'Posts' tag are updated, reflecting the new post.
   - This automatic cache update ensures that the latest data is available across all query endpoints that depend on the same tag(s).

Tags provide a flexible and powerful mechanism for managing caching in RTK query. They allow you to control cache invalidation, trigger selective refetching, and ensure consistent data updates across different parts of your application. By leveraging tags effectively, you can optimize the caching behavior and ensure efficient data fetching in your Redux-based applications.
